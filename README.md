# Movie_Data_Analysis

 I love movies, and video games, and movies about video games. So when I was assigned this project, I had a really fun time. "What's the project?" you may ask. Well, I'm telling you.
  Hypothetical situation: Microsoft decides they want in on some of that sweet, sweet movie money folks like Disney and Sony and Warner Bros are making. So they've asked me to figure out how best to go about doing that. Now I already have the answer to that: Halo. Make movies about the game series Halo. They don't even have to be that good, they just need to have 'Halo' in the title, and probably get Nathan Fillion involved and it'll do great.

  But other things needed to be done....
## The Data
 Now we were given a number of datasets already, but none of them were really recent enough for me. So I ended up doing a good bit of web scraping. You see, I donated $5 to Wikipedia one time, so I think that entitles me to all their data forever. And that data really helped. Also I ended up just creating several datasets on my own by doing research. The financial info I got on the Resident Evil franchise was all compiled from various sources across the internet, as well as the data from Microsoft properties and how much money they've made over the years.

## The Process
 Like I mentioned earlier, there was a good bit of web scraping taking place here, but most of this project was about cleaning the data: sussing out the stuff we want and dumping what we don't.
 
## Results
  As you might as picked up already, I started this whole thing with a predetermined conclusion. Now I know that's not the best way to go about doing things, but because I acknowledeged that it won't be a problem. Plus, this was a lot more fun.
  
## Future considerations
 One of the things I ran across was the concept of studios making similar movies; Armageddon vs Deep Impact, Olympus has Fallen vs White House Down, Sharknado vs Orcacane (I bet for a second, just a second, you thought there WAS a movie called Orcacane....just give it time), and I thought it'd be interesting to see what factors went into which one succeeded.
